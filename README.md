## 🎉 **Hey, I’m Anonyd0go**  
*(a.k.a. the dude who’s lived a few lives and landed in tech)*  

I’m a **tech enthusiast** with a wild path. Kicked things off with a psychology degree, but nah, that wasn’t it. Swapped books for punches and dove into **Mixed Martial Arts**—mostly BJJ and Kickboxing. Needed cash, so I sailed the seas as a **merchant mariner** for three years (yep, real waves, real vibes). Now, I’m all about tech—been studying for a year and a half, chasing that sweet spot where I can learn nonstop and make a living. Knocked out **CS50x**, snagged **Google’s IT and Cybersecurity certs**, and I’m halfway through **Holberton’s fullstack program**. Always been a tech nerd at heart, but now it’s official. Currently obsessed with **Cybersecurity** and **AI**, especially where they vibe with aerospace and IoT. Adventure’s my fuel, and code’s my canvas. 🚀

- **Frameworks**: Flask, SQLAlchemy (ORMs, REST APIs, web app magic)  
- **Tools**: JSON, Ubuntu, Debian, Windows  
- **Learning**: Rust (taking my time with it)
- **Biggest flex**: Coded a simple shell and an AirBnB clone—check ‘em below.

## 💻 **Projects I’m Proud Of**  
- **[holberton-simple_shell](https://github.com/anonyd0go/holberton-simple_shell)**: A bash clone in C. Taught me the nitty-gritty of processes and why memory management is life. Efficiency’s my jam now.  
- **[holberton-hbnb](https://github.com/anonyd0go/holberton-hbnb)**: My heavyweight champ—an AirBnB clone. Packed with database vibes, ORMs, clean project structure, and network comms. It’s in the process of getting production-ready, and I’m hyped about it.
