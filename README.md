I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. My journey into tech has been anything but conventional. I started with a degree in psychology, transitioned to Mixed Martial Artist for a bit, and spent three years as a merchant mariner before dedicating myself to software development.

This diverse background has equipped me with a unique problem-solving perspective and a relentless drive to learn and adapt. Over the past year and a half, I've immersed myself in a rigorous full-stack curriculum at Holberton School, complemented by certifications from Google in IT Support and Cybersecurity.

## **Currenttly working on & Featured Projects**
### Phishing URL Detector with XAI
A full-stack AI security tool that classifies URLs as legitimate or phishing with 98.9% accuracy. What makes it unique is its implementation of Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP, which provides transparent, human-readable explanations for every prediction. It’s not just a black box; it’s a tool for understanding threats.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Streamlit, Jupyter Notebooks
  
- **[holberton-simple_shell](https://github.com/anonyd0go/holbertonschool-simple_shell)**: A bash clone in C. Taught me the nitty-gritty of processes and why memory management is life.  
- **[holberton-hbnb](https://github.com/anonyd0go/holbertonschool-hbnb)**: A full-stack clone of AirBnB, built with a Python/Flask RESTful API and a dynamic frontend. A deep dive into database management, user authentication, and system architecture.

## 🥋 **Outside of the Code**
When I'm not at my keyboard, you can find me on the mats practicing BJJ and Kickboxing, exploring the world through hiking and spearfishing, or immersing myself in new languages—currently focused on Japanese (日本語を勉強しています) and Russian.
